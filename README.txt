Rory Gatson (CSCE 646 Project Notes): 

This code has been modified to perform a ripple blur effect.
The ripple radiates from a user defined point in the image and can be modified in multiple ways by the user.
The period length slider will determine the period of the sine funciton that defines the ripple.
Kernel size refers to the kernel of the box blur within the altered region of the image.
Color modifiers can be used to see the effect better and to create more iteresting images.

I ran this code using the live server extension in VSCode but it can be ran using any local hosting application for web development.


This is Varda Grover's basic webgl filter code. 

The following links are a nice introductory and detailed resource to webgl, that could be helpful getting started.
They have code samples to explain practically. And it also has a section where they explain and implement filters. 
They have publicly available webgl utility files too.

You can download Webstorm (the IDE for running javascript,html and webgl code on local host) : https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/.
It is free for students and teachers.
