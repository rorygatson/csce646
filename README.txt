Rory Gatson (CSCE 646 Project Notes): 

This code has ben modified to run a Curve Integral Convolution with Implicit Functions.
There are four example functions to use as a demonstration. 


I ran this code using the live server extension in VSCode but it can be ran using any local hosting application for web development.


This is Varda Grover's basic webgl filter code. 

The following links are a nice introductory and detailed resource to webgl, that could be helpful getting started.
They have code samples to explain practically. And it also has a section where they explain and implement filters. 
They have publicly available webgl utility files too.

You can download Webstorm (the IDE for running javascript,html and webgl code on local host) : https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/.
It is free for students and teachers.
